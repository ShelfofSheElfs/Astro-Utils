# Astro-Utils

Welcome to Astro-Utils. This is my small little corner for everything astro-related that I need now, yesterday, or probably tomorrow because I'll forget how to do it.

# Current Foci

**Currently observing:** Comet 2025 K1 (ATLAS) (7/7 Files Calibrated, 7/7 Imaged)  
**Currently Studying:** Asteroid (911) Agamemnon

## Navigation!

If you REALLY don't want the filesystem that GitHub gives, use this fake one instead:

## What I'm Working On

\> ACP Protocol Generator  
&nbsp; For when I need a quick observatory control file to send to a remote observatory. (Quick meaning 5 minutes plus the weeks of waiting for that one cloud to pass...)  

\> SBDB/MPEC Ephemeris Generator
