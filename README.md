# Astro-Utils

Welcome to Astro-Utils. This is my small little corner for everything astro-related that I need now, yesterday, or probably tomorrow, because I'll forget how to do it.

# Current Foci

**Currently observing:** Comet 2025 K1 (ATLAS) (1/6 Files Calibrated, 5/6 Imaged)  
**Currently Studying:** Asteroid (911) Agamemnon

## Navigation!

If you REALLY don't want the filesystem that GitHub gives, use this fake one instead:

\> Studies  
&nbsp; \> [Agamemnon](https://www.github.com/ShelfofSheElfs/Astro-Utils/Agamemnon-Study)  
\> Utilities (Under construction)  
&nbsp; \> Under construction... Still...  

## What I'm Working On

\> ACP Protocol Generator  
&nbsp; For when I need a quick observatory control file to send to a remote observatory. (Quick meaning 5 minutes plus the weeks of waiting for that one cloud to pass...)  

\> SBDB/MPEC Ephemeris Generator  
&nbsp; [I just want more streamlined ephemerides](https://media.tenor.com/EnfUQlTnMF8AAAAi/disintegrating-meme-aughh-meme.gif

#### Contact

You can get to me three main ways:  
\> <shelfofsheelfs@proton.me> for all the Proton users.  
\> <rjohn372@montgomerycollege.edu> for all the academic stuff.  
\> Snacks and hardcore metal music work for everything else.  

Thank you and happy observing \<3
